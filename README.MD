# Flexlay

Flexlay is a CSS-only library aiming to build on the concepts initially defined on Angular Material 1 on how to model a layout using CSS flexbox, being both capable of standalone use apart from Angular, or as a CSS core foundation for a Angular 2 Module.

This project is still a proof of concept and has just started development. If you're horribly missing Material Layout on Angular2, want a CSS-flexbox library more comprehensive than flexboxgrid, just wants to contribute to open source but are scared of huge projects with so many files, I am really open for you to help out on this project. Help me make the best out of this idea.

## Roadmap

At the moment ot this writing, not a single line of useful CSS (SASS) had been written, just setup the repo but my mind was just cycling on how to do this, the tooling, documentation and attract people. However, I think I can write a rough sketch of what I plan to do / what is needed to do.

- [ ] Setup a node-sass buildchain (I'll use NPM because reasons)
- [ ] Initial styles based on Angular Material
- [ ] Setup NPM deployment
- [ ] Setup tests (what kind? Im not CSS Test Expert. At most, I know linting)
- [ ] Setup documentation (readme.md style? gh-pages style? what can make this easier?)
- [ ] Define serious conceptual documents for things missing, mental models that needs refinement, etc. Part of docs.
- [ ] Whatever the community ends up really asking of this
