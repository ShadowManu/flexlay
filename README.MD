# Flexlay

Flexlay is a CSS-only library aiming to build on the concepts initially defined on Angular Material 1 on how to model a layout using CSS flexbox, being both capable of standalone use apart from Angular, or as a CSS core foundation for a Angular 2 Module.

This project is still a proof of concept and has just started development. If you're horribly missing Material Layout on Angular2, want a CSS-flexbox library more comprehensive than flexboxgrid, just wants to contribute to open source but are scared of huge projects with so many files, I am really open for you to help out on this project. Help me make the best out of this idea.
